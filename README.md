# 💾 Fileusage


A simple C++ command-line application that recursively traverses directories in a windows based system to report the amount of
space each file is using. A good tool to help keep track of a directories fileusage!


## ✨ Technologies

- `C++`
- `Visual Studio 2022`

## 🚀 Features

- Ability to search all files that aren't hidden or restricted
- User determine the order of which the analytics are returned
- A handy tool for managing space

## 📍The Process

I first created Fileusage back in 2023 and the goal was to have a lightweight application to manage my storage througout my second semester in college.
Note: The application has the ability to give a full report of the entire `C:/` directory, however I strongly advise against doing so at the momment due to the current 
version not utilizing an effective algorithm. (You might be waiting a while for that report...)
